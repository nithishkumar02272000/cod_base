# Python code to convert an audio Mp3 File to Wav file format 
First, you would need to install the Pydub library, which can be done using pip:

!pip install pydub

You can save this script as a Python file, such as "audio_converter.py".

To run this script, you would need to specify the path to the MP3 files folder and the output WAV files folder as command-line arguments. Here's an example of how to run the script from the command line:

python audio_converter.py --mp3_folder "path/to/mp3/files" --output_folder "path/to/output/wav/files"
